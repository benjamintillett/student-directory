Student Directory 
=================

The student directoory is the first project I did at the makers academy. It is was written in ruby and uses the command line 
as an interface. 

The student directories script allows you to manage the list of student enrolled on the course at Makers Academy

How to use
----------

Clone the repository:

```shell 
git clone git@github.com:benjamintillett/student-directory.git

```

Run the file:

```shell 
ruby directory.rb
```
